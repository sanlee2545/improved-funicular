* KNN Search Algorithm Implementations
This set of programs has rudimentary implementations of:
- Ball Tree;
- Locality Sensitive Hashing;
- Vanilla KNN.
** Dependencies and Requirements
Python3
** How to Run Program
Download all ~*.py~ files and use ~python main.py~ or ~python3
main.py~ to run a test of the three different algorithms. The time and
error will be measured and displayed. The ~test_knn()~ method in
~nearest_neighbors.py~ will generate a dataset of points ~(x, f(x))~
where ~f(x)=x^2+w~ and ~-1<=w<=+1~ is a random noise term.
** Notes
I wanted to implement Nearest Neighbors because it is an interesting
and elegant Machine Learning method. I chose Ball Trees and Locality
Sensitive Hashing as representatives of Approximate Nearest Neighbor
methods. Locality Sensitive Hashing took a long time to understand.
