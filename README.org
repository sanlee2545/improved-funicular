* KNN Search Algorithm Implementations
- Ball Tree
- Locality Sensitive Hashing
- Vanilla KNN
** Dependencies and Requirements
Python3
** How to Run Program
Download all ~*.py~ files and use ~python main.py~ to run a test of
the three different algorithms. The time and error will be measured
and displayed. The ~test_knn()~ method in ~nearest_neighbors.py~ will
generate a dataset of points ~(x, f(x))~ where ~f(x)=x^2+w~ and ~w~ is
a random noise term in ~[-1,+1]~.
